        Zero Two Is Like a Vampire
        Everyone knows how vampires operate. They seduce their victims before draining them of their blood. The same fate awaits the partners of Zero Two; she drains them of their life force until they are goners. In fact, Zero Two once described Hiro as fodder.
        
        Going back to her prominent color scheme, red is also associated with vampires. Zero Twoâ€™s fangs are also similar to vampiric fangs.
